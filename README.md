# spam_sms_detection

This project builds a model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam) using machine learning.

# Objective
Detect spam messages in SMS using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Train a machine learning model to classify messages accurately.

# Project Structure
sms_spam.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with all the code.

spam.csv → Dataset containing SMS messages and their labels.

README.md → Project documentation (this file).

# Dataset

The dataset used is spam.csv, which contains labeled SMS messages.

Labels:

ham: Legitimate messages

spam: Unwanted promotional or fraudulent messages

# Features

✅ Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.)

✅ Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

✅ Classification using machine learning models (e.g., Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM)

✅ Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

✅ Spam Detection – Identify spam messages with high accuracy.

✅ Machine Learning – Uses NLP & ML techniques for classification.

✅ Easy to Use – Just input an SMS and get the prediction.


# Installation

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+). Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classifier.git
cd sms-spam-classifier

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook sms_spam.ipynb

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

# Evaluation Criteria

Functionality: Does the model correctly classify spam and ham messages?

Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and efficient?

Innovation & Creativity: Are there any unique features or optimizations?

Documentation: Is the implementation clearly explained in the notebook and README?



# Steps in the Project
Load Data 📥 – Import SMS dataset (spam.csv).

Preprocess Data 🔄 – Clean text (remove symbols, stopwords, etc.).

Feature Extraction 🛠️ – Convert text into numerical format using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.

Train Model 🎯 – Use a machine learning model (e.g., Naïve Bayes).

Evaluate Model 📊 – Check accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Test on New Messages ✉️ – Predict if a message is spam or not.


# Model Performance
Accuracy: 95%+ (depends on the model used).

Precision, Recall, and F1-score calculated for better evaluation.

#  Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy 📊

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
